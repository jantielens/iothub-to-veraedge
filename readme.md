# Azure IotHub to Vera sample #
A basic sample of how to send commands to a Vera (http://getvera.com/) Z-Wave controller, without having to open any inboud ports on your home network. This NodeJS app needs to run on a device in your home network (e.g. a Raspberry Pi). The app connects to an Azure IoT Hub, which can send direct commands to turn on/off a light switch for example.
